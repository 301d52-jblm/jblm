<!-- VISION -->
<!-- This product is meant to help the administrator and the visitors of the page alike. There is currently a divide in what users see vs what is available. This product will bridge that gap making it easy for users to get connected. This is important because it saves time, money and resorces for our client. -->



<!-- SCOPE -->
<!-- IN -->
<!-- Our product will be easy for users to get connected to JBLM.
The web app will have a calender to show what events are upcoming.
The web app will have a facebook feed to keep people connected to whats going on.
The administrator will have a route to edit the calender events. -->

<!-- OUT -->
<!-- Our web app will only be editable by the admin. This means having a fairly secure route for the admin. This webb app will also be professional, not personal. So it needs to look the part. -->



<!-- MVP -->
<!-- Having a working API
Have the calender editable by the admin, also edit resources -->

<!-- STRETCH GOALS -->
<!-- Making the client happy
Make the cite pretty -->



<!-- FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS -->
<!-- A admin can create and delete calender events.
User can update and create items on the resource page.
A User can view the calender and facebook feed along with other information about the base. -->



<!-- NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS -->
<!-- Secure for the admin route so only those who have the link can change the calender. This means that the admin will be able to keep the calender the way they want it. Secure means that it will not be reachable by users. It will be a route that ONLY the admin will have a link to.

Usability so users can easily manuver the cite. Usability means that it is easy for people who have never been on the cite to know what all the features are right away. We want this cite to be for everyone interested in JBLM events. -->



<!-- DATA FLOW -->
<!-- When a user comes to the cite they will see a navbar with an image carousal beneath it. under that there will be a facebook feed, calender/calender  events and contacts. You can click on the facebook feed and be on the facebook page. Click on the calender information and go to the full screen calender. Or click on the resources to see the full list of resources. All of these pages are also accessible by using the var bar which will be on each page. -->
